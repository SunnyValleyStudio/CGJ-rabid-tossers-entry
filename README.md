###### Rules:
* No NSFW games.
* Everything has to be made during the jam. This means you can't reuse any code or assets you made before the jam or from other sources. 
* You can use fonts from the internet, as long as you have the correct license for it.
* Asset store assets are not allowed either, except for the ones that don't contribute to the game itself but make the workflow easier. You can use the tools that are in the Unity Package manager, except for the standard assets. 
* All game engines and frameworks are allowed.
* Generators are allowed, as long as you have some control over the output.
